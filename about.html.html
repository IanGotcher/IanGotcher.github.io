Project:  Project1-About Me

I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs: This assignment wasn't too difficult since I've worked with HTML before, and W3Schools was very helpful.
Trying to keep the table formatted correctly when adding row spans was a bit tedious but I was always able to figure it out after some trial-and-error in Firefox.
For the extra points I chose to do the following: Changing the font, changing the hyperlinks so that they are only underlined when hovered over, indenting my poem,
table text alignment, and equal table column widths.

For the poem I chose to use <blockquote> since that seemed like the perfect solution for easily indenting a block of text. This file uses internal CSS, which made
it very easy to format this file the way I needed it to be.

		<h2>The Incentive</h2>
		<p>Thinking about peanut butter chocolate ice cream:</p>
		<p>
		<blockquote>
			I want some junk food<br>
			but I am working right now<br>
			better work faster.
		</blockquote>

		<h2>My personal interests</h2>
		<p>
		&emsp;&emsp;I like to listen to music whenever I'm working, driving, or chilling out. This can be anything from classical music to jazz to video game and movie soundtracks to Death Grips.<br>
		The composers I've probably listened to the most are Beethoven, Bach, and Shostakovich. In terms of soundtracks, Nintendo, in the decades that it's been around, <br>
		has produced a huge amount of consistently high quality music for their games, so I've listened to their stuff a lot.
		</p>
		<p>
		&emsp;&emsp;I'm also a gamer. Most of the time I play games with my friends, for the past few months we've been playing Monster Hunter: World and basically nothing else<br>
		We recently tried this new game called Lethal Company and it was a blast, there are so many interesting mechanics and quirks that combine to cause so many hilarious moments occur.<br>
		When I have lots of spare time (mainly during the summers), I also like to sink my teeth into great singleplayer games. This last summer I played the new Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,<br>
		It was a fantastic experience and you could easily see all the hard work they put into the game. I've also beaten Dark Souls III a few times.
		</p>
		<p>
		&emsp;&emsp;In terms of professional interests, I'm hoping to become a professional software engineer. I'm on track to graduate Spring 2025, so hopefully I can find an internship this summer<br>
		and keep doing well in my remaining classes. In recent months I've also been very minorly considering applying to law school as a backup plan if I can't achieve my goals in the tech world.<br>
		But in order to do that I'll have to keep increasing my practice LSAT score so I can get into a good school.<br>
		But I am confident that I will succeed in the tech world.
