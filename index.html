    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Experienced CS Master’s Student at Yale University expected to graduate this year, with industry experience in software QA,
        proficiency and research experience in AI/ML technologies, and certification in cybersecurity. I graduated summa cum laude with a B.S. in
        Computer Science from Utah Valley University, where I developed leadership skills as the VP heading the Academics Branch within the student government.<br><br>

        As a Research Assistant at UVU, I designed custom pathfinding algorithms and co-authored a conference presentation.
        At Legrand, I led beta and alpha testing for a network management platform, implementing automated tests across web, Android, and iOS to ensure seamless releases.
        Finally, my CompTIA Security+ certification complements my relevant coursework in data privacy and security.<br><br>

        I am eager to leverage my technical expertise and leadership from student government to drive impactful AI and security solutions at innovative tech firms.</h3>
